\section{Introduction}

Bucheton and Soulé have described the act of teaching as a multi-agenda game of postures requiring good preparation and excellent micro-decisions \cite{BS09}. In their model, they identify the crucial roles of the teacher in controlling the cadence, the atmosphere, the scaffolding and the relationships during the class, and how each supports the learning objective. And yet many of the teacher's most time-consuming tasks do not take place in the classroom: good preparation and strong follow-ups (auto-reflection, marking, parent-teacher interactions) work to support and complement the overall success of the student learning process.

For example, teacher responsibilities include the ability to [TODO: citation needed]
\begin{itemize}
\item plan and implement effective classroom management practices,
\item design and implement effective strategies to develop independent learners,
\item engage students in active, hands-on, creative problem-based learning,
\item build students’ ability to work collaboratively with others,
\item maintain a safe, orderly environment conducive to learning,
\item adapt instruction/support to students’ differences in development, learning styles, strengths and needs, and
\item write student reports to guide changes in instruction and practice, and to improve student learning.
\end{itemize}

Many of these tasks are ripe for automation \cite{Swei15}, although I would also accept that some of these tasks should \textbf{not} be automated (even if they can be). As John Hattie explains in \emph{Visible Learning} \cite{Hat12}, \emph{``Expert teachers monitor learning and provide feedback.''} In my opinion writing student reports are a perfect example of a necessary evil: although time consuming (and potentially stressful) for the teacher, writing a student report forces the teacher to reflect on the progress of the student and at the same time manage the expectations of all partners - student, teacher, management and parent.

So which tasks should be automated? Why? And for whom? When I first started teaching, my natural character led to two bad teaching practices: I found it difficult to engage with the quieter, more reserved students; and I was so busy answering student questions that I left little time for taking notes. I felt my teaching (and so hopefully also my students' learning experience) would benefit from a tool which tracked my interactions in class in an attempt to shift the focus away from the "louder" students. 

TODO: discussion on equality for students, and \cite{Hat12} on answering too quickly.

But if I start recording a brief comment at an opportune moment after a positive (or negative) interaction with a set of students, I could also use this to build a reminder of the interactions per student: an incredibly useful trick when planning lessons, writing reports, and especially for parent evenings.

For the Master's thesis project undertaken for the GymInf formation, I built a suite of tools to support a range of teacher tasks including organising seating plans, building individual student reports, suggesting teacher-student interactions for upcoming classes, and creating spreadsheets of marks. 

\

I will now explain the layout of this thesis. In sections \ref{inout} and \ref{actions} I outline the planned architecture of the system, explaining how it can be built incrementally. While I sometimes take the opportunity to explore alternative solutions, in general I mainly explain and defend my decisions.

\

The tools will be coded in Python. This choice of language is mainly because Python is the language we teach our students, see section \ref{language}, and I would like to take this opportunity to consolidate my Python skillset.

\

I also wanted to use this thesis to improve my coding style, exploring the industry technique of \emph{test driven development} as explained in section \ref{tdd}. The majority of my contemporaries from university who ended up in university have highly recommended this coding style, and while it has disadvantages (as discussed later) there are strong reasons to having it as an option \cite{Amman16}. TODO proper link to book.

\



\

Given the limited resources of this masters' thesis, not all of the desired functionality has been delivered. These missing features are described in section \ref{notdone}. Please note that the current codebase was designed with these features in mind, and that existing code should require minimal changes to incorporate these features as they are added.


\section{System plan: inputs and outputs} \label{inout}

We can analyse a system by connecting its (physical or virtual) inputs and outputs. In this project, we have

\

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.38\textwidth}

\textbf{Inputs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Class lists
\item Commentary on students
\item Seating plan used in class
\item Exam notes
\end{itemize}


\end{minipage}
\hfill
\vline
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}

\textbf{Outputs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suggested students for focus
\item Suggested seating plans
\item Average notes for the semester
\item Individual student reports
\end{itemize}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{5mm}

The inputs clearly contain sensitive information, and the relevant laws and best practices with regards to student data will be discussed further in Section \ref{dataprivacy}. It is also worth pointing out that the processed data (data during calculations and the outputs) is also sensitive. In general we should try to store as little personal data as possible. TODO citation needed.

\subsection{Explanation of inputs}

\subsubsection{Class lists}
For each class of interest, we need to have a list of students who are members of this class. For each student, it is often useful to store a "given" name with which they like to be called in class. Other information is not essential (gender, age, etc.), and so we will not store it.

\subsubsection{Commentary on students}
During the teaching process, the teacher makes useful judgements about students and groups of students. The teaching process obviously includes contact time during classes, but it can also include thoughts and decisions during the planning process, while marking homework or exams, or while evaluating a lesson \emph{ex-post}.

Comments could take the form
\begin{itemize}
\item Excellent definition of Pythagoras' Theorem
\item Good explanation of photosynthesis on blackboard
\item Very quick with past continuous exercises
\item Chatting
\item DNF \emph{(homework not done)}
\item Seemed unashamed that he did not know the formula for the area of a triangle.
\end{itemize}

To each comment should be associated the student, the class and the date. Thinking ahead, It would be very useful to also include whether or not the comment was positive or negative: see the "focus" and "report" outputs, respectively sections \ref{output_focus} and \ref{output_report}.

\subsubsection{Seating plan used in class}
Especially at the start of the year, but also just after holidays, it can be difficult to remember the given names of students. By asking the students to follow a seating plan \emph{and then having this seating plan to hand,} the teacher has an easy way to refer to students by their given name. At the start of the year this also helps the teacher in learning the names. See figure \ref{seatingplan} on page \pageref{seatingplan} for an example of a seating plan created using the tikz package of LaTeX. As far as possible, I followed the format of seating plans used during exams at Collège Rousseau : thus the seating plan layout should be familiar to both students and teachers.

\subsubsection{Exam notes}

The individual exam results will be needed in order to calculate the average note for each student for each semester, section \ref{output_notes}. We will also need the weighting associated with each exam, and by including the date of the exam we can check the progression of students, section \ref{output_report}.




\subsection{Explanation of outputs}

\subsubsection{Suggested students for focus} \label{output_focus}

As a student teacher, I found it hard to balance my time equitably among the students in a class. Certain students, perhaps those who were louder or more confident, tended to capture my attention. By keeping a record of my interactions with students, it was possible to estimate an ordering of students by recent interactions, and so indicate students who require teacher \emph{focus} during the next set of teacher-student interactions (probably during the next class).

This \emph{focus} can be very simple: these are the students to whom the teacher addresses the opening questions. These opening questions can revise topics from the last lesson or prepare the students for the ideas to be tackled in this lesson. Students who respond positively to an early question are much more likely to volunteer answers later in the class TODO citation needed.

\

Let us model the interactions with a given student by simply counting the number of interactions on a given day.

\begin{tcolorbox}
Comments:

01/06/2023 Harry gives conclusion of Pythag \\
01/06/2023 Harry, Ron correct calc litt \\
08/06/2023 Harry calculates hypotenuse.
\end{tcolorbox}
We define a function $f_H : \mbox{Dates} \to \mathbb{N}$ to count the interactions with Harry
$$ f_{H}(d) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 2 &  \mbox{if} & d=\mbox{01/06/2023} \\ 1 & \mbox{if} & d=\mbox{08/06/2023}  \\ 0 && \mbox{otherwise.} \end{matrix} \right. $$
and a corresponding function $f_R$ for the interactions with Ron
$$ f_{R}(d) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 &  \mbox{if} & d=\mbox{01/06/2023}  \\ 0 && \mbox{otherwise.} \end{matrix} \right. $$

We would like to create a weight operator, $W$, which would map these functions to a real number. This operator should measure the number of recent interactions, giving more weight if there have been more interactions. For example, Harry has had more interactions than Ron and so we expect $W(f_H) > W(f_R)$.

Ideally negative interactions should \textbf{not} be counted in this weighting; otherwise "difficult" students would be unlikely to be chosen for positive interactions.

\section{System plan: user actions} \label{actions}

We can also model a system by considering the possible actions. We can then analyse the sub-processes inside the actions, which can suggest a natural architecture for the system.

\subsubsection{Record a remark about a set of students}

\subsubsection{Suggest students for interpolation}

\subsubsection{Modify the seating plan}
 
 
 
 
\subsection{Actions outside of teaching}
 
\subsubsection{Prepare student reports}

\subsubsection{Suggest a seating plan}

\subsubsection{Review previous seating plans}

\subsubsection{Prepare spreadsheets for noting an exam}

\subsubsection{Collate marks and calculate semester note}





\subsection{Actions to set up the classes}
 
\subsubsection{Add a class to the list of classes taught}

\subsubsection{Configure the class lists}
The \emph{class list} is the list of students in a given class.

\subsubsection{Suggest a seating plan}

\subsubsection{Configure constraints in a seating plan}
I would like to be able to take into account the needs of certain students. For example, short-sighted students often ask to sit in the front row, as do students with hearing difficulties. More rarely, students have asked to sit away from the windows because of hay-fever. These constraints could be handled by specifying particular seats as "preferable" for a given student.

Pairs of students often asked to be sat together. The decision as to whether or not these requests are accepted should rest with the teacher, but it would be a nice to have when automatically generating seating plans.


\section{Choice of programming language} \label{language}

\subsection{Previous personal experience}

I have experience programming in a number of languages : I used \textbf{Basic} and a bit of \textbf{assembler} as a child, then \textbf{Delphi} (Visual Pascal) as a teenager, next \textbf{C++} as a grad student, and then I used \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Matlab} extensively when I worked in industry. I tried \textbf{Scala}, \textbf{Clojure} and \textbf{Julia} during my years transitioning to teaching, and more recently during my GymInf studies I have also had to learn \textbf{Python} and \textbf{Prolog}.

In general, apart from Prolog, these languages feel quite similar. Some are more weighted towards object-oriented programming (Delphi, Java and Scala) but in general the virtual machine can be modelled as storing the program as a text file and executing the instructions line by line. Variables are declared and assigned values, and expressions are evaluated using iterative rules. Except for Basic and Assembler, which still allow Djikstra's nemesis the \texttt{GOTO} command, the virtual machine has control of the general flow of the execution using \emph{functions} or \emph{events} (the latter are in some sense just functions owned or controlled by objects). If we ignore naughty tricks, the programmer can only use switch statements, \texttt{if-elif-else}, \texttt{switch}, or \texttt{case}, to adjust the execution path at a very local level.

The other distinction between the languages is whether or not they are \emph{functional}. Functional languages do not allow the redefinition of a variable, such as Prolog, Clojure and Scala. 


TODO discussion of functional languages.

I considered the following factors when choosing the language for my project:
\begin{itemize}
\item my current proficiency,
\item my interest for improving my proficiency,
\item ease for finding solutions to coding problems,
\item readability of the code,
\item maintainability of the code,
\item future applications of improved coding abilities.
\end{itemize}

There are other factors which did not affect my decision at the start of coding : for example, creating the GUI (graphical user interface), deployability of the code, the speed and reactivity of the program, or whether the code would be scalable. I will comment on these oversights in the conclusion.



\subsection{New languages}
Alongside \textbf{Scala} (syntactic sugar over Java with a functional feel) and \textbf{Julia} (Matlab maths functionality built directly on C++), the other \emph{new} languages I considered using were \textbf{Swift}, \textbf{Clojure} and \textbf{Rust}.

TODO discussion of these new languages: why they were created, their advantages and disadvantages and possible 

\subsection{Python}
At Collège Rousseau, where I teach, we decided to teach the students Python. This was a difficult decision, with each language having advantages and disadvantages. Like the vast majority of Secondary II schools in Switzerland, we decided that the low barrier to entry, the wide use of Python in industry, the teachers' current abilities, the large support community, and the focus of readability narrowly outweighed the use of weak (duck) typing with beginners.

The teacher is expected to have a strong background in the coding language being taught :
\begin{itemize}
\item for the pedagogical benefits of "live coding", modelling how to create code for the students to discuss and learn from, TODO citation needed
\item creating well written code for students to study,
\item for ease of marking and correcting (lots of) student code,
\item for spotting mistakes in student code during class time, in order to suggest hints, and
\item for recognising bad coding practices and explaining to students the potential pitfalls and how to avoid them,
\item for understanding error messages.
\end{itemize}

\section{The graphical user interface} \label{gui}

\subsection{Choice of language}

\subsection{Implementation style}

\subsection{Views}
A classic GUI structure is to use \emph{views}, different screens designed for different use cases.
 
TODO: citation needed.

I based the GUI views on the three phases defined when reviewing the types of actions in section \ref{actions}: configuration, teaching, and planning. I wanted to be able to use some of the planning actions while teaching, for example suggesting students for interaction, so I moved these to the teaching view. This meant "planning" only left those actions directly related to proposing seating plans, so the "planning" phase is really only "planning the seating plan". Thus I have called the respective views the \textbf{control view}, the \textbf{class view}, and the \textbf{seating plan view}.

\subsubsection{Control view}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the active class.
\item Pass to the class view of the active class.
\item Create a new class.
\item Edit the class list.

\item Calculate average notes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Class view}

The class view includes the seating plan, both as a reminder for names and as a visual cue for interactions.

\section{Project proposal}

Bucheton and Soulé have described the act of teaching as a multi-agenda game of postures requiring good preparation and excellent micro-decisions \cite{BS09}. In their model, they identify the crucial roles of the teacher in controlling the cadence, the atmosphere, the scaffolding and the relationships during the class, and how each supports the learning objective. And yet many of the teacher's most time-consuming tasks do not take place in the classroom \cite{Bryant20}: good preparation and strong follow-ups (for example auto-reflection, marking and parent-teacher interactions) work to support and complement the pillars identified in the student learning process.

Many of these tasks are ripe for automation. As Sweigart writes, ``many people spend hours clicking and typing to perform repetitive tasks, unaware that the machine they’re using could do their job in seconds if they gave it the right instructions'' \cite{Swei15}.  For my thesis project of the GymInf formation, I intend to build a suite of tools to support a range of teacher tasks including 
\begin{itemize} 
\item organizing seating plans \\
\emph{to aid the atmosphere and relationships} 
\item suggesting teacher-student interactions for upcoming classes \\
\emph{to foster relationships}
\item building individual student reports \\
\emph{to regulate cadence and scaffolding, as well as for follow-ups}
\item creating spreadsheets of marks \\
\emph{for follow-ups}
\end{itemize}
Teachers will interact with the tool using a GUI: it should be easy to use for all teachers, not just those teachers who are computer literate.


I will implement this project using \emph{Test Driven Development.} This is a style of software development that grew out of the `Extreme Programming' philosophy of the 1990s, encouraging quick development cycles and active feedback from clients. The first book written on the subject, \emph{TTD by Example}, by Kent Beck, is still the main resource \cite{Beck03}. Kent emphasises the need to thoroughly test the requirements in order to have confidence when refactoring or making changes, as well as the need to make incremental changes (both for confidence and for time to market). TTD programming follows the following cycle: \\
\indent \textbf{Red.} Write a failing test for a requirement. \\
\indent \textbf{Green.} As quickly as possible, write code to pass the test. \\
\indent \textbf{Refactor.} Clean the code, removing duplication and renaming functions. \\
Coding is driven by testing. In the thesis I will explore testing in more detail.
