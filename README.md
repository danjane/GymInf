*Thesis project for the masters.*

I intend to build a suite of tools to automate some of the boring tasks currently being done by teachers (i.e. me, the prime example). 

Alas, I don't intend to automate marking, student comments or lesson planning. However I do intend to attempt to implement the following:
* Automated seating plans (alphabetic, homogenous, heterogenous).
* Collating the teacher's in-class comments on students.
* Suggesting students on which to concentrate in upcoming classes.
* Creating an individual report for each student.
* Autogenerating an excel file with student notes at the end of term.

Comments welcome.
